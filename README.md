# Minesweeper
Minesweeper Game written in C++

# How to Play
You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. 
Players are prompted for a row and a column to reveal. If the tile that the player chooses is a bomb, they lose. If they manage to reveal all the squares that aren't bombs, they win. At the end of each game, win or lose, all of the bombs on the gameboard are revealed.

# Rules
* If the tile is not a bomb but is adjacent to at least one, then the tile will show the number of bombs that the tile is adjacent to.
* If the tile is not a bomb and is NOT adjacent to at least one:
     * Not only does the tile become visible, but all 8 surrounding tiles are made visible following the previously mentioned rule.  
* As each tile becomes exposed, it is considered whether if it is adjacent to a bomb or not.
* If it is then the count of bombs it is adjacent to is shown.
* If it is not adjacent to one, it is made visible and the game continues in the same way. This can result in a large number of tiles to become visible with a single tile selection!

# Legend
